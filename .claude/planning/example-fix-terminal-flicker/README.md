# ⚠️ EXAMPLE ARTIFACTS - FOR REFERENCE ONLY

This directory contains **example artifacts** demonstrating what the workflow commands produce. These files are for documentation and learning purposes.

## What This Is

This is a complete example workflow showing all artifacts generated for a real feature:
- **Feature:** Fix terminal view flickering issue
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate the workflow in action
- **Status:** Example only - not an active project

## Artifacts Included

- `CODE_RESEARCH.md` - Example research output from `/research-code`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Example plan from `/issue-planner`
- `PROJECT_SPEC.md` - Example specification from `/issue-planner`
- `CODE_REVIEW.md` - Example review from `/review-code`
- `STATUS.md` - Example status tracking throughout workflow

## How to Use These Examples

**Learn the format:** See what each workflow phase produces
**Understand structure:** Reference when creating your own artifacts
**Check completeness:** Compare your outputs against these examples

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT modify these files** - they serve as reference documentation
- **DO NOT use this as a working directory** - create your own issue folders
- These examples were created with the **old verbose format** - new artifacts will be more concise (see commands for current format)

## Your Workflow

When you run the workflow commands, they will create **new directories** like:
```
.claude/planning/
├── fix-terminal-flicker/  ← Example (ignore this)
├── your-feature-name/     ← Your actual work
└── another-feature/       ← Your actual work
```

**This is a read-only example. Start your own workflow with `/research-code` or `/issue-planner`**
