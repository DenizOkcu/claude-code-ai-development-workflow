# AI Development Workflow with Claude Code

Structured slash commands for complete software development lifecycle: Research → Planning → Implementation → Review.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Research - generates issue name (e.g., "add-oauth-auth")
/research-code Research OAuth2 authentication patterns with Google and GitHub

# 2. Plan - use the generated issue name
/issue-planner add-oauth-auth

# 3. Implement
/execute-plan add-oauth-auth

# 4. Review
/review-code add-oauth-auth
```

**All commands automatically update `STATUS.md`** - your centralized progress tracker.

## ⚠️ Delete Example Before Using

The `.claude/planning/fix-terminal-flicker/` directory contains **example artifacts** for learning. Delete it before using this workflow in your own repository. Commands will create new directories automatically for your real features.

## Workflow Commands

### 1. `/research-code [description]`

Deep codebase analysis before planning. **Generates issue name** from description.

**What it does:**
- Generates issue name from your description (e.g., `add-oauth-auth`)
- Investigates architecture, patterns, conventions
- Identifies integration points and dependencies
- Assesses risks and technical debt
- Creates recommendations
- **Creates STATUS.md** to track workflow progress

**Output:** Issue name (auto-generated), `CODE_RESEARCH.md`, `STATUS.md`

**Example:**
```bash
/research-code Research OAuth2 authentication patterns for implementation
```
→ Generates issue name: `add-oauth-auth`

**When to use:** Before implementing new features, unfamiliar code areas, complex features

**STATUS.md after:**
```
- [x] Research - Completed
- [ ] Planning - Not started
```

---

### 2. `/issue-planner {issue-name}`

Transform requirements into actionable plans. **Uses issue name** generated by research-code.

**What it does:**
- Reads CODE_RESEARCH.md (if exists) and STATUS.md
- Creates detailed implementation plan with phases
- Designs technical architecture and specifications
- Plans testing strategy
- **Updates STATUS.md** with planning completion

**Output:** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `PROJECT_SPEC.md` | **Updates:** `STATUS.md`

**Example:**
```bash
/issue-planner add-oauth-auth  # Issue name from research-code
```

**When to use:** After research phase, non-trivial features, structured planning needed

**STATUS.md after:**
```
- [x] Research - Completed
- [x] Planning - Completed
- [ ] Implementation - Not started
```

---

### 3. `/execute-plan {issue-name}`

Systematically implement the planned feature. **Uses issue name** from previous commands.

**What it does:**
- Reads IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, PROJECT_SPEC.md, STATUS.md
- Creates comprehensive todo list
- **Updates STATUS.md** to "In Progress" with current phase
- Implements code phase by phase
- Writes tests alongside implementation
- Tracks progress with todo list
- **Updates STATUS.md** when complete

**Output:** Implementation code, tests | **Updates:** `STATUS.md`

**Example:**
```bash
/execute-plan add-oauth-auth  # Issue name from research-code
```

**When to use:** After planning phase, when IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md exists

**STATUS.md during execution:**
```
- [x] Research - Completed
- [x] Planning - Completed
- [~] Implementation - In Progress (Phase 2/4)
- [ ] Review - Not started
```

**STATUS.md after completion:**
```
- [x] Research - Completed
- [x] Planning - Completed
- [x] Implementation - Completed (8 files, 23 tests)
- [ ] Review - Not started
```

---

### 4. `/review-code {issue-name}`

Comprehensive code review and quality assurance. **Uses issue name** from previous commands.

**What it does:**
- Reads STATUS.md, plans, research docs for context
- **Updates STATUS.md** to "Review In Progress"
- Runs automated checks (linting, types, tests, build)
- Performs manual code review
- Security and performance assessment
- Creates detailed review report
- **Updates STATUS.md** with approval status

**Output:** `CODE_REVIEW.md` | **Updates:** `STATUS.md`

**Example:**
```bash
/review-code add-oauth-auth  # Issue name from research-code
```

**When to use:** After implementation, before committing/deploying, after fixing issues

**STATUS.md after (if approved):**
```
- [x] Research - Completed
- [x] Planning - Completed
- [x] Implementation - Completed
- [x] Review - Completed ✓ APPROVED
- [ ] Deployment - Ready
```

**STATUS.md if needs work:**
```
- [x] Research - Completed
- [x] Planning - Completed
- [x] Implementation - Completed
- [x] Review - ⚠ NEEDS REVISION (2 critical, 3 important issues)
```

---

## Language Commands

### `/typescript-pro [description]`

**Location:** `.claude/commands/language/typescript-pro.md`

**Purpose:** Advanced TypeScript development with strict type safety, generics, and enterprise patterns.

**Example:**
```bash
/typescript-pro Design a type-safe event system with typed handlers
```

**When to use:** Complex TypeScript challenges, type system design, advanced typing patterns

---

## File Organization

All artifacts are organized by issue name in `.claude/planning/{issue-name}/`:

```
.claude/planning/
├── add-oauth-auth/          # Issue directory
│   ├── STATUS.md           # ⭐ Central progress tracker
│   ├── CODE_RESEARCH.md    # Research findings
│   ├── IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
│   ├── PROJECT_SPEC.md
│   └── CODE_REVIEW.md
└── fix-memory-leak/
    ├── STATUS.md
    └── CODE_RESEARCH.md
```

**STATUS.md** = Single source of truth for workflow state, updated by all commands.

---

## Issue Name Format

**Auto-generated by `/research-code`** from your feature description.

**Rules:**
- **kebab-case** (lowercase-with-hyphens)
- **Concise** (2-5 words)
- **Descriptive** of feature/fix

**Examples:**
- ✅ `add-oauth-auth`, `fix-memory-leak`, `refactor-api-layer`
- ❌ `AddOAuthAuth` (not kebab-case), `fix` (too vague), `add-new-auth-with-oauth2` (too long)

**How it works:**
1. `/research-code Research OAuth2 patterns` → generates `add-oauth-auth`
2. Use generated name in all subsequent commands: `/issue-planner add-oauth-auth`

---

## Complete Workflow Example

**Scenario:** Add JWT authentication with refresh tokens

```bash
# Step 1: Research - generates issue name "add-jwt-auth"
/research-code Research existing JWT authentication patterns with refresh token support

# Output:
#   - Issue name generated: add-jwt-auth
#   - CODE_RESEARCH.md (findings about existing auth/)
#   - STATUS.md created
# STATUS.md: [x] Research | [ ] Planning | [ ] Implementation | [ ] Review

# Step 2: Plan - use generated issue name
/issue-planner add-jwt-auth

# Output:
#   - IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (4 phases)
#   - PROJECT_SPEC.md (technical design)
#   - STATUS.md updated
# STATUS.md: [x] Research | [x] Planning | [ ] Implementation | [ ] Review

# Step 3: Check progress (anytime)
cat .claude/planning/add-jwt-auth/STATUS.md

# Step 4: Implement - use same issue name
/execute-plan add-jwt-auth

# During execution:
# STATUS.md: [x] Research | [x] Planning | [~] Implementation (Phase 2/4) | [ ] Review
# After completion:
# STATUS.md: [x] Research | [x] Planning | [x] Implementation | [ ] Review

# Step 5: Review - use same issue name
/review-code add-jwt-auth

# Output:
#   - CODE_REVIEW.md (comprehensive review)
#   - STATUS.md updated
# STATUS.md: [x] Research | [x] Planning | [x] Implementation | [x] Review ✓ APPROVED

# Step 6: Check final status
cat .claude/planning/add-jwt-auth/STATUS.md

# Step 7: Commit and deploy
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add JWT authentication with refresh tokens"
git push
```

## Tips & Best Practices

### Always Check STATUS.md First
```bash
cat .claude/planning/add-jwt-auth/STATUS.md
# Shows: where you are, what's done, what's next
```

### When to Skip Research
- Trivial changes (typo fixes)
- Very familiar code areas
- Clear implementation path

### When Research is Critical
- New features in unfamiliar areas
- Complex architectural changes
- Integration with existing systems

### Iterative Workflow
```bash
# Update plans if needed
/issue-planner add-jwt-auth  # Re-plan
/execute-plan add-jwt-auth   # Re-implement

# Fix issues after review
# Fix the code manually
/review-code add-jwt-auth     # Re-verify

# STATUS.md tracks all iterations
```

### Multiple Features
```bash
# Work on multiple features simultaneously
/research-code Research OAuth2 authentication patterns  # → generates: add-oauth-auth
/research-code Research memory leak in data processor   # → generates: fix-memory-leak

# Each gets its own directory and STATUS.md
.claude/planning/add-oauth-auth/STATUS.md
.claude/planning/fix-memory-leak/STATUS.md

# Continue each workflow independently
/issue-planner add-oauth-auth
/issue-planner fix-memory-leak
```

## Next Steps

Try the workflow with a simple feature:

```bash
/research-code Research patterns for implementing a health check endpoint
```

This will:
1. Generate an issue name (e.g., `add-health-check`)
2. Create `.claude/planning/add-health-check/` directory
3. Research your codebase and create CODE_RESEARCH.md
4. Guide you to run: `/issue-planner add-health-check`

**Check STATUS.md anytime to see where you are!**
